# premarket-mover-bot
An experiment with Algotrading. At 9:30am EDT this bot finds the biggest positive premarket movers and shorts them with a (soon to be trailing) stop loss.

Premarket stock data scraped from https://www.benzinga.com/money/premarket-movers/.

Currently paper trading on Alpaca. 
Someone please give me capital. I don't have enough to get around the Pattern Day Trader rule.
